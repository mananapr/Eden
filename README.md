[Live Demo](https://mananapr.github.io/Eden/) of <i>Eden</i>.

About
-------------------------------

<i>Eden</i> is a startpage with a simple layout.

A startpage/homepage is a local website, namely you'll be able to access it thanks to files present on your computer (in general, it'll be a .htm file), and some browser like Firefox Mozilla and Google Chrome will allow you to set a custom homepage. What's more, thanks to some add-ons/extensions such as 'New Tab Homepage' for FF or 'New Tab Redirect' for Chrome, you'll be able to set this said startpage as you new tab page (amazing isn't it ?). There are a lot of custom startpage on the net, you can check this list of startpage http://startpages.github.io/ or search some of them on github/deviantart. 

Instruction
-------------------------------

<strong>Step 1 : Right click on the <i>.htm</i> file and open it with a browser of your choice</strong>

<strong>Step 2 : Set the startpage as the homepage </strong>
<ul>

<p>For Mozilla Firefox</p>
<ol> 
<li> go to the settings or copy/paste <i>about:preferences</i> in the URL bar. In <i>General</i>, copy/paste the URL of the startpage (it should be something like <i>file:///C:/Users/[Your name]/Documents/EDEN/index.htm</i> in <i>Home Page</i> and choose the option <i>Show my home page</i> for <i>When Firefox starts</i>.</li>
<li> download the add-on <i>New Tab Homepage</i> (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-homepage/), it'll redirect you to your homepage each time you open a new tab.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>For Google Chrome</p>
<ol> 
<li> go to the settings. In <i>Appearance</i>, check <i>show home page</i> and modify the link with the URL of the startpage. </li>
<li> download the extension <i>New Tab Redirect</i> (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna?hl=en). </li>
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<strong>Step 3 : Install the font </strong>

I use several fonts for the startpage.

<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/pacifico">Pacifico</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto">Roboto</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.freejapanesefont.com/bokutachi-no-gothic-2-regular-download/">Bokutachi no Gothic 2</a></li>
</ol>

Features
-------------------------------

<span><i>Eden</i> has one main feature.</span>
<ol>
<li>In the search bar, by entering some special keys, such as <i>-y jazz music</i>, you'll be able to search directly on youtube and not on Google. Another exemple with `-w moe`, it'll search 'moe' on wikipedia.</li>
</ol>

Customizing
-------------------------------

### Dates
- open the `.htm` file in a text editor, search for 'var days' (it'll be at the beginning of the document), and change the days (instead of 'dimanche' you can write 'sunday' or 'domingo').

``` javascript
/* DAYS AND MONTHS IN ENGLISH */
var days = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wenesday','thursday.','friday','saturday'];
```

### Search
- open the `js` folder and edit `search.js` in a text editor , you'll have to modify the following code 
``` javascript
case "-u":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=" 
break;
```
- first, you have to decide of a website (I will take bato.to) and a special key for this said site : I will take -b, thus you'll have the following code

``` javascript
case "-b":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=" 
break;
```
- after that, you'll need to replace the value of `window.location`, in the example of batoto you'll have to go to the site and search for something, for example if I'm looking for Hinamatsuri (a pretty gud manga, you should read it asap), the link will be `http://bato.to/search?name=Hinamatsuri&name_cond=c`, you'll have to copy the link before 'Hinamatsuri', namely `http://bato.to/search?name=`, and you'll have the following code 

``` javascript
case "-b":
query = query.substr(3);
window.location = "http://bato.to/search?name=" 
break;
```
